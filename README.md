# Introduction

The 'AI Want Coffee' project assesses the potential of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) using the 'Wozniak test', which challenges a robot to enter a house, make and serve coffee. It incorporates skills such as autonomous navigation and speech recognition. The focus is on testing OpenAI's GPT-4 model in real scenarios, exploring how its natural language processing and response generation can aid in developing AGI for complex tasks in unstructured environments.
